# Project Tooling

This repo is used for Project Tooling. A project that tries to cover several tools that are relevant for C++ development.

Each time the question is basically:
If you could pick your favorite tool for <purpose X>, what tool would that be?

Starting with version control, compilers, unittest frameworks etc.

# Version Control

As version control tool I choose: **Git**. I wanted a distributed VCS for my project, with support for easy & local branches.
As long time SVN and also git-svn user I'm very curious to experience the true power of git.
I did consider Mercurial though and it was a good second. I read that it has a clean and simple interface (especially for SVN-users).

# Vagrant

I used vagrant to describe the development enviroment to be able to recreate and expand it with ease. Keeping my main-system clean is also a big plus.
Currently it's a simple Xubuntu-box, with Clang as compiler.
See vagrant/README.md for more details.

# Visual Code

Visual Code as IDE was not succesful in the Mint Virtual Machine.
It does not work.
